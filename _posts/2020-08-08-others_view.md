- Tip 1. Why do we care?
   If people had negative opinions of you it was a life and death thing (in ancient times)

- Tip 2. Understand the position of the opinion givers. 
  Don't listen to those who
	- don't have a proper understanding of your situation
	- do not have the same value system
	- do not have your best interests at heart
- Tip3. Learn to separate opinion from fact and ignore useless opinions.
	- opinion: your work is rubbish  
	- facts: you need to reduce grammar mistakes  
- Tip4. What could we do?
	-  Make my own metric system and value system.
	- When I give an opinion, should be in the best interest of others and given from a position of compassion.
