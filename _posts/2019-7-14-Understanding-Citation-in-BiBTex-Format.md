BibTex entries of different types have different fields. There are three types of fields:

- **required** You must provide information for these fields.
- **optional** The fields' information will be used if present.
- **ignored** BibTeX ignores any other fields. This means you can include anything you want in the BibTeX entry without worrying about messing up the reference section.
